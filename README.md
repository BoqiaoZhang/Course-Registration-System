# A Course Registration System

## Brief Introduction to This System


This project is designed as a course registration system. The main functions of this system were listed below. These 
functions could well serve the **students** of a university after being set up by the **university staff**.

The Main Functions of This System:
- As staff, setting the university course list
- As students, researching a course in the course lists
- As students, checking whether there are available seats for a course
- As students, registering or dropping the course 

<p>Such an idea came to my mind mainly based on three reasons. First, course registration system is close to our 
real university life. Second, course registration system is one of the most important systems in university. 
Third, I found it possible to make some improvements for the course registration systems of some universities.</p>
