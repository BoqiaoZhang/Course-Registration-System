# A Course Registration System

## Brief Introduction to This System

Available Functions of This System:
- Researching a course in the course lists
- Checking whether there are available seats for a course
- Registering or dropping the course 

This project is designed as a course registration system. The main functions of this system includes: searching a
course, checking the remaining available seats and registering/dropping a course. These functions could well serve the 
**students** of a university after being set up by the **university staff**.

<p>Such a project hooked my interest mainly because of three reasons. First, course registration system is close to our 
real university life. Second, course registration system is one of the most important and frequently used system in
university. Third, I found it possible to make some improvements for the course registration systems of some 
universities.</p>
